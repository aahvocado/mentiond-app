# mentiond
I made this because there's always something cool being recommend to me by friends - a new tv show, an old movie, a must-try restaurant. Sometimes multiple friends would mention the same thing and so I thought, "I should make a thing to keep track of these suggestions". This is the thing! It tracks mentions in categories and sorts them by most mentioned. When satisfied, swipe right on the mentionable to mark it complete. There's so much media out there that I get overwhelmed and never get to any of them, but this helps me fight that indecisiveness but just looking at my most mentioned Cartoons list!

### Usage
[mentiond.app](https://mentiond.app)

Run wild!

### Roadmap
- login creation, so I can use database storage instead of local
- tags and descriptions for mentionables
- shareable lists
